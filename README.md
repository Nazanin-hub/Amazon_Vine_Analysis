Analyzing Amazon reviews using PySpark

## Project Overview

analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin.
Then, I used PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in my dataset.
